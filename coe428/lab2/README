QUESTION 1: Suppose that towers(5, 2, 3) is invoked

 1. The towers three parameters are (4, 2, 1). since n = 5, n-1 gives us 4. The source remains the same. The destination is found using the formula 6-2-3, which gives a value of 1. 

2. The total amount of recursive calls found is 31 to the initial invocation. One method to solving this is doing 2^(5)-1 = 31.

3. The Stdout for towers(5, 2, 3)

4. The tower for the second recursive calls is towers (3,2,3). Since it is going down twice it will go from 5 to 3 (n-2). The source remains the same. The destination for the first recursive was 1, so when plugging into the formula 6-2-1 = 3, therefore we get 3 as our destination. 

5. For towers(8,1,2). To solve for the number of lines that will be printed we use the formula 2^(n) -1. In our case, our n = 8. 2^(8) - 1 = 255. Therefore there will be 255 lines printed out. (Move #255).
