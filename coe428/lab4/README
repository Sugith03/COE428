For this lab, The code for simState does seem to run efficently, although the delete portion tends to popup an error stating "segmentation fault (core dumped) simState". Now the error has been fixed with minor changes as well as garbage. The file is capable of compiling, picking the correct column (0 or 1) and is able to change the new state letter for C. Hence, it can also send it to garbage as well, but during delete it becomes an error. Overall the difficlty of this lab was hard due to the error, but it was fixed at the end.
