To modify Requirement 1 to allow for self-balancing stand-alone tags we can add an additional check after step 2. If the tag ends with a '/' (slash) preceding the final >, then it is a stand-alone tag, and we can skip steps 3 and 4. We do not need to push the tag onto the stack or pop it off the stack since it is self-balancing. The modified 

Algorithm would be:
1. Read the input until the beginning of a tag is detected.
2. Read the tag's identity.
3. If the tag ends with a '/' (slash) preceding the final >, then it is a stand-alone tag. Skip steps 4 and 5.
4. If the tag was a start-tag, push it onto the stack.
5. If the tag is an end-tag, pop the stack and verify that the popped identity is the same as the end-tag just 
processed.
6. If the identities do not match, the XML expression is invalid.
7. If they do match, then no error has been detected (yet!).
8. If there is still input that has not yet been processed, go back to the first step.
9. Otherwise (no more input), the input is valid unless the Stack is not empty.

Modification, the algorithm will correctly handle self-balancing stand-alone tags in addition to start and end tags.
